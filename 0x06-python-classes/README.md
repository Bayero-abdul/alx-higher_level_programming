* [Object-Oriented Programming](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/qz3KSn154ia4H2DPaabOzg) (Please *be careful*: in most of the following paragraphs, the author shows things the way you should not use or write a class in order to help you better understand some concepts and how everything works in Python 3. Make sure you read everything in the following paragraphs: General Introduction, First-class Everything, A Minimal Class in Python, Attributes (You DONT have to learn about class attributes), Methods, The __init__ Method, Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding, Public, Protected, and Private Attributes)
